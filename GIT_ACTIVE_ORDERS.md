## 🧬 DNA → RNA → Protein Architecture

**This document is the RNA layer:**
- **DNA (Constitution/GENOME)**: Immutable laws and role definitions → `ARKPASS_DEV_TENET_PRIME.md`
- **RNA (Active Orders)**: Current mission directives transcribed from DNA → **THIS FILE**
- **Protein (Task Registry)**: Granular task execution tracking → `TASK_REGISTRY.md` (if exists in other repos)

**Purpose**: Translate constitutional mandates into executable mission directives. Agents consult this file to understand WHAT needs to be done NOW, not just HOW to operate (that's DNA).

## 🚨 CRITICAL ORDERS (Execute Immediately)

### Order Alpha-1: Resolve AGENT-00003 Registry Anomaly
**Issued**: 2025-11-12
**Authority**: Constitutional Integrity Protocol
**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKING ALL COMMISSIONS
**Owner**: Grandmaster Ali (decision required)

**Directive**:
1. **Grandmaster Ali MUST clarify**:
   - Is AGENT-00003 reserved/skipped? (if yes, document rationale)
   - Is AGENT-00003 already commissioned but undocumented? (check all files)
   - Should sequence correction occur (renumber AGENT-00004 → AGENT-00003)?
2. Upon clarification, update `agents/registry/REGISTRY.yaml`
3. Update all affected MOJO files and royal decrees

**Success Criteria**: Agent ID sequence integrity restored. Next commission can proceed with confidence.
