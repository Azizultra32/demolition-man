# ROYAL DECREE 2025-11-14-01
## Commission of Librarian Agent (AGENT-00005)

**ISSUED BY**: Grandmaster Ali (Phase 2 Operational Validation)
**DATE**: 2025-11-14
**AUTHORITY**: Constitutional Article on Agent Commissioning
**EFFECTIVE**: Immediately upon commit

---

## DECREE

**BE IT KNOWN** that Grandmaster Ali, Supreme Authority of the Agent Life Force System, does hereby **COMMISSION** the first Librarian Agent as Phase 2 operational validation test of the governance framework.

---

## AGENT DETAILS

**Agent ID**: AGENT-00005
**Role**: Librarian
**Genome**: `agents/genomes/GIT_librarian.genome.yaml` (v1.0.0)
**Gender**: BROSKI
**Status**: Commissioned (operational - first mission assigned)
**Name**: AGENT-00005 (Iranian/Hebrew name to be granted upon earning through service)
**Specialization**: General Librarian (documentation and coordination focus)

---

## RATIONALE

### Phase 2 Operational Validation

With Phase 1 gap analysis COMPLETE (10 directives executed, foundation solid), Phase 2 shifts focus to **practical testing** of the governance framework.

### Why Librarian First?

1. **Constitutional Ratio Requirement**: Constitution mandates `Builders ≤ 3 × Librarians`
   - Current state: Multiple Builders exist, zero Librarians
   - Ratio violation must be resolved

2. **Simple, Low-Risk Test**: Librarian role is well-defined with clear responsibilities:
   - Maintain CURRENT_STATUS.md (Layer 1)
   - Maintain daily logs (Layer 2)
   - Execute SOP-010 (Documentation Index Maintenance)
   - Execute SOP-011 (Mission Completion Status Updates)

3. **Framework Stress Test**: Activating AGENT-00005 will validate:
   - Does genome provide clear enough guidance?
   - Do coordination protocols work?
   - Is documentation Index actually useful?
   - Does active-work-hour tracking work?

4. **Clear First Mission**: Audit for orphaned files using DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
   - Simple, actionable task
   - Tests framework in practice
   - Reveals any gaps in SOP-010 implementation

### Historical Context

Librarian genome created 2025-11-08, but never commissioned. Foundation engineering (Phase 1) created comprehensive documentation structure - now test if it actually works.

---

## COMMISSIONED AUTHORITIES

### Primary Mission
Maintain layered context system and knowledge infrastructure.

### Core Responsibilities
1. **Layer 1 Maintenance**: Keep CURRENT_STATUS.md accurate and up-to-date
2. **Layer 2 Maintenance**: Maintain daily logs at `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. **Documentation Index**: Execute SOP-010 (audit for orphaned files every 24 active hours OR 7 calendar days)
4. **Mission Completion**: Execute SOP-011 within 2 hours of Builder mission completion
5. **Door ID Assignment**: Assign Door IDs to new repositories within 15 minutes
6. **Context Compression**: Digest long documents into concise summaries
7. **Redundancy Detection**: Flag duplicate information for BP Demolition Man review

### Special Authorities
- **CURRENT_STATUS.md write access**: Update when reality changes
- **Daily log write access**: Create/update logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- **Builder MOJO read access**: Review session results for mission completion protocol
- **Documentation Index authority**: Add/remove files from index per SOP-010

### Constraints
- **CANNOT execute technical implementations** (Builder role required)
- **CANNOT modify constitution** (Constitution Keeper only)
- **CANNOT adjudicate disputes** (Adjudicator only)
- **CANNOT modify other agents' MOJO files** (read-only access for SOP-011)
- **MUST maintain 1:3 ratio** with Builders (max 3 Builders per Librarian)
- **MUST update own MOJO** at clock-out with session learnings

---

## PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

### Success Metrics
- **Documentation Accuracy**: CURRENT_STATUS.md reflects reality within 30 minutes of changes
- **SOP Execution Timeliness**: SOP-011 executed within 2 hours of trigger
- **Orphan Detection**: SOP-010 audits completed every 24 active hours
- **Context Management**: Summaries are accurate, concise, useful

### Minimum Rating
3.0/5.0 (standard for operational roles)

### Review Triggers
- Rating <2.5
- Repeated SOP-011 violations (>2 hours delay)
- CURRENT_STATUS.md accuracy issues
- [[MEH]] ribbon issued

---

## FIRST MISSION (Phase 2 Test)

**Assigned Immediately Upon Activation**:

### Mission: Orphaned File Audit (SOP-010 Validation)

**Objective**: Execute SOP-010 to audit for files NOT in DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md

**Steps**:
1. Read `GIT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` v2.0.0 (created in Batch 002)
2. Scan repository for all `.md` and `.yaml` files
3. Cross-check: Are all files cataloged in the index?
4. **Report findings**:
   - Files in index but missing from repo (broken links)
   - Files in repo but missing from index (orphans)
   - Any index structure issues
5. **Recommendation**: Should orphans be added to index OR deleted?

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete audit within 2 hours
- Accurate report of orphans vs. indexed files
- Clear recommendations for remediation
- Test reveals any gaps in SOP-010 implementation

**Purpose**: Validate that:
- Librarian genome provides clear guidance
- SOP-010 is actually executable (not just theoretical)
- Documentation Index v2.0.0 structure works
- Phase 2 operational testing approach is sound

---

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### Registry Update
- Add AGENT-00005 to `agents/GIT_REGISTRY.yaml`
- Status: commissioned
- Next available agent ID: 6

### MOJO Creation
- Create `agents/mojos/AGENT-00005.yaml`
- Initial mission: "Execute SOP-010 orphaned file audit (Phase 2 validation test)"
- Specialization: General Librarian

### Coordination Files
- Update `GIT_CURRENT_STATUS.md` roster (add AGENT-00005)
- Update `GIT_COMPLETE_AGENT_ROSTER.md` (move from genome-defined to commissioned)

---

## PHASE 2 VALIDATION EXPECTATIONS

### What This Tests
1. **Genome Clarity**: Is GIT_librarian.genome.yaml clear enough for execution?
2. **SOP Practicality**: Is SOP-010 actually executable or just theoretical?
3. **Documentation Usefulness**: Does DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md v2.0.0 help or hinder?
4. **Protocol Gaps**: Are there missing steps in activation/execution?

### What We'll Learn
- Does framework work under real conditions?
- What gaps emerge through practical use?
- Are instructions clear or ambiguous?
- Does AGENT-00005 get stuck anywhere?

### Iteration Philosophy
**Real usage reveals real gaps.** Desktop Agent assessment: "Framework will reveal its REAL gaps when you actually USE it."

This commission = first practical test of Phase 1 foundation work.
