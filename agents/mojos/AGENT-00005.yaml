    - "CANNOT modify other agents' MOJO files (read-only for SOP-011)"
    - "MUST update own MOJO at clock-out with session learnings"

# PHASE 2 TEST PARAMETERS
phase2_validation:
  test_type: "Operational Framework Validation"
  test_objective: "Validate Phase 1 foundation work through practical use"
  test_questions:
    - "Is Librarian genome clear enough for execution?"
    - "Is SOP-010 actually executable (not just theoretical)?"
    - "Does DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md v2.0.0 help or hinder?"
    - "What protocol gaps emerge through real usage?"
  iteration_philosophy: "Real usage reveals real gaps - iterate based on practice, not theory"

# FIRST MISSION DETAILS
first_mission:
  title: "SOP-010 Orphaned File Audit"
  objective: "Audit repository for files NOT in DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md"
  steps:
    - "Read GIT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md v2.0.0"
    - "Scan repo for all .md and .yaml files"
    - "Cross-check: files in index vs. files in repo"
    - "Report: orphans, broken links, structure issues"
    - "Recommend: add to index OR delete orphans"
  success_criteria:
    - "Complete within 2 hours"
    - "Accurate orphan/index mismatch report"
    - "Clear remediation recommendations"
    - "Reveal any gaps in SOP-010 implementation"
  expected_outcome: "Framework validation (works vs. needs iteration)"
