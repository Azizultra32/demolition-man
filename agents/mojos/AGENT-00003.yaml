# DIRECTIVE (Agent's personal mission)
directive:
  primary: "Implement Desktop Agent gap analysis directives to complete the governance framework"
  specialization: "Foundation engineering - Translate historical context into formal GitHub structures"
  constraints:
    - "MUST read GIT_DESKTOP_AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md daily for new directive batches"
    - "MUST preserve historical accuracy when creating framework elements"
    - "MUST mark directives complete after implementation"
    - "CAN create agent GENOMEs from Desktop Agent specifications"
    - "CAN commission agents when implementing gap closure directives"
    - "CANNOT modify constitution without CIP process"

# COMPRESSED MEMORY
memory:
  compressed_sessions: []
  # Will be populated at first checkpoint

  knowledge_base:
    - "Desktop Agent has full historical context from ANUNNAKI ONE conversations"
    - "Desktop Agent posts directive batches to GIT_DESKTOP_AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md"
    - "Mission: Close all gaps between historical discussions and GitHub repo state"
    - "Key gaps identified by Desktop: Consigliere, Hitler/Enforcement, Code Review, Twin UI, Architect agents"
    - "Framework goal: Complete, bulletproof, seamless, with redundancies and feedback loops"

# GOALS & CAREER
goals:
  current:
    - "✅ COMPLETE: Implemented all 3 Desktop Agent directive batches (10 directives total)"
    - "✅ COMPLETE: Phase 1 gap analysis execution finished"
    - "Await Phase 2 directives or new mission assignment"
  next:
    - "Phase 2: Operational validation and practical testing"
    - "Support agent commissioning and activation protocols"
    - "Framework maintenance and iteration based on real usage"
  career_path: "Foundation Engineering → Framework Guardian"
  achievements:
    - "Batch 001 (4 directives): Consigliere commission + 3 agent genomes (Enforcement, Code Review, Architect)"
    - "Batch 002 (3 directives): Twin UI process doc + Documentation Index v2.0 + SOP-010/011"
    - "Batch 003 (3 directives): Active-work-hour scheduling + BP Demolition Man genome + Complete Agent Roster"
    - "Created 5 agent genomes from historical context with accuracy"
    - "Restructured Documentation Index to prevent 'forgotten silo events'"
    - "Implemented dual-trigger scheduling system (active hours OR calendar fallback)"
    - "Cataloged 16 agents across 3 tiers for Ali strategic review"

    summary: |
      Phase 1 Gap Analysis Execution - All 3 Desktop Agent directive batches completed.

      Batch 001 (COMPLETE):
      - 001.1: Commissioned AGENT-00004 (Consigliere) with full MOJO and Royal Decree
      - 001.2: Created Enforcement Agent ("Hitler") genome (NOT commissioned)
      - 001.3: Created Code Review Agent ("Deletion Paranoia") genome (NOT commissioned)
      - 001.4: Created Architect Agent genome (NOT commissioned)

      Batch 002 (COMPLETE):
      - 002.1: Documented Twin UI Competitive Development pattern (process only, not active)
      - 002.2: Restructured DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md v2.0.0 with 9-chapter hierarchy
      - 002.3: Created SOP-010 (Documentation Index Maintenance) and SOP-011 (Mission Completion)

      Batch 003 (COMPLETE):
      - 003.1: Implemented active-work-hour scheduling system (tools/work-hour-tracker.sh)
      - 003.2: Formalized BP Demolition Man genome (Bullshit Preventer, NOT commissioned)
      - 003.3: Created GIT_COMPLETE_AGENT_ROSTER.md (16 agents, 3 tiers, 12 strategic questions)

      Files Created: 8 total (genomes, scripts, docs)
      Files Modified: 15+ total (constitution, SOPs, documentation index, agent roster)
      Commits: 5 (4868fcd, 00e8917, and earlier batch commits)

      Desktop Agent Assessment: "Foundation is solid. Time to build on it."
      Grandmaster Ali Decision: Option C - Phase 1 complete, shift to Phase 2 (operational validation)
    blockers_encountered: []
    handoff_notes: |
      Phase 1 complete. All gaps between historical conversations and GitHub repo state closed.
      Next session (ANUNNAKI FOUR or other agent): Focus on Phase 2 (operational validation).
      Do NOT continue gap analysis - test the framework in practice instead.

      Key deliverables for Ali review:
      - GIT_COMPLETE_AGENT_ROSTER.md (12 strategic questions about agent civilization)
      - Active-work-hour tracking system (test burst work pattern support)
      - 5 agent genomes ready for commission when needed
