## Session Registry

### Session 1: Context Window Investigation + Infrastructure Deployment

**Session ID**: claude/context-window-investigation-011CV3f4LDqRVG7je42wgv9Q
**Agent**: Claude Code (temporary Builder role, no MOJO assigned)
**Role**: Infrastructure deployment + investigation
**Clock-In**: 2025-11-12 ~08:11 UTC (estimated from git timestamps)
**Clock-Out**: IN PROGRESS
**Context Budget**: 200,000 tokens
**Current Context**: ~80,000 tokens (~40%) <<Context 40%>>

#### Mission
Execute Grandmaster Ali's directive to:
1. Close context window investigation (RESOLVED: prompt caching explains 44% usage)
2. Read canonical files (Testament, status, logs)
3. Deploy coordination infrastructure (CURRENT_STATUS.md, ACTIVE_ORDERS.md, logs/, etc.)
4. Address immediate priority items from carry-over package

#### Deliverables
- [x] Read ARKPASS_DEV_TENET_PRIME.md (Testament v3.0.0)
- [x] Read README.md (repository structure)
- [x] Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md (agent operating handbooks)
- [x] Read adjudications/2025-11/OUTSTANDING_ITEMS_NOT_FOUND_IN_CONSTITUTION.md (23 gaps identified)
- [x] Read consigliere/briefings/ROYAL-DECREE-*.md (AGENT-00001, AGENT-00002 commissions)
- [x] Created CURRENT_STATUS.md v1.0.0 (Layer 1 coordination)
- [x] Created ACTIVE_ORDERS.md v1.0.0 (RNA layer mission directives)
- [x] Created logs/2025-11-12.md (this file - Layer 2)
- [ ] Create DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Create SOP_LIBRARY.md (PENDING)

#### Checkpoint Summaries

**50% Mid Summary (NOT REACHED YET)**
- Tokens Used: ~80k / 200k
- Context: <<Context 40%>>
- Status: Infrastructure deployment in progress, 60% complete
- Next: Complete DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md, SOP_LIBRARY.md, then commit

**75% Late Summary (NOT REACHED YET)**
- TBD

**90% Final Summary (NOT REACHED YET)**
- TBD

#### Blockers Identified
1. **AGENT-00003 Registry Gap** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Royal Decrees commissioned AGENT-00001, AGENT-00002
   - Next sequential should be AGENT-00003
   - Grandmaster instructions reference AGENT-00004 for Consigliere
   - **Resolution needed**: Grandmaster must clarify AGENT-00003 status

2. **Zero Librarians** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Ratio violated: 1 Builder, 0 Librarians (requires ≥1)
   - AGENT-00001 cannot activate until ratio satisfied
   - **Resolution needed**: Commission Librarian(s)

3. **Missing Agent Role Definitions** 🟡 HIGH
   - "Hitler" Enforcement Agent referenced but not defined
   - Code Review/Deletion Paranoia Agent referenced but not defined
   - Architect Agent mentioned, unclear if needed
   - **Resolution needed**: Grandmaster searches old files (king2.txt) for specs

4. **5 CIPs Awaiting Approval** 🟡 HIGH
   - CIP-2025-11-08-02 through CIP-2025-11-08-06 drafted
   - Require Grandmaster Ali review
   - **Resolution needed**: Consigliere (once commissioned) consolidates into Royal Briefing

#### Decisions Made
- **Context window investigation CLOSED**: Prompt caching explains 44% usage (not auto-summarization)
- **Infrastructure priority order**: CURRENT_STATUS.md → ACTIVE_ORDERS.md → logs/ → DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md → SOP_LIBRARY.md
- **DNA/RNA/Protein architecture established**:
  - DNA = Constitution (unchanging GENOME)
  - RNA = ACTIVE_ORDERS.md (current missions)
  - Protein = TASK_REGISTRY.md (granular tasks, may exist in other repos)

#### Files Modified
- Created: `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (new)
- Created: `ACTIVE_ORDERS.md` (new)
- Created: `logs/` directory (new)
- Created: `logs/2025-11-12.md` (this file - new)

#### Git Operations
- Branch: `claude/context-window-investigation-011CV3f4LDqRVG7je42wgv9Q`
- Commits: 0 (pending completion of all deliverables)
- Push Status: Not yet pushed

#### Communications
- No flash messages issued
- No inter-agent coordination (solo session)
- Context meter: <<Context 40%>> [over]
