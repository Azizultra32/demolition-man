#### Checkpoint Summaries

**50% Mid Summary** (Delivered at ~95k tokens)
- Tokens Used: ~95k / 200k
- Context: <<Context 48%>>
- Status: Infrastructure deployment 100% complete (5 files)
- Blockers: 5 critical identified (AGENT-00003 gap, zero Librarians, Desktop gap analysis pending, missing role defs, 5 CIPs pending)
- Strategic Decision: Grandmaster confirmed Option B (checkpoint now vs. continue with Desktop directives)

**54% Checkpoint** (Session End)
- Tokens Used: ~108k / 200k
- Context: <<Context 54%>>
- Phase: Checkpoint complete
- Handoff: Created comprehensive handoff for ANUNNAKI THREE
- Desktop Protocol: Established AI-to-AI communication (no human relay)
- Next Agent: Awaits Desktop agent gap analysis → implements directive batches

#### Blockers Identified
1. **AGENT-00003 Registry Gap** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Royal Decrees commissioned AGENT-00001, AGENT-00002
   - Next sequential should be AGENT-00003
   - Grandmaster instructions reference AGENT-00004 for Consigliere
   - **Resolution needed**: Grandmaster must clarify AGENT-00003 status

2. **Zero Librarians** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Ratio violated: 1 Builder, 0 Librarians (requires ≥1)
   - AGENT-00001 cannot activate until ratio satisfied
   - **Resolution needed**: Commission Librarian(s)

3. **Missing Agent Role Definitions** 🟡 HIGH
   - "Hitler" Enforcement Agent referenced but not defined
   - Code Review/Deletion Paranoia Agent referenced but not defined
   - Architect Agent mentioned, unclear if needed
   - **Resolution needed**: Grandmaster searches old files (king2.txt) for specs

4. **5 CIPs Awaiting Approval** 🟡 HIGH
   - CIP-2025-11-08-02 through CIP-2025-11-08-06 drafted
   - Require Grandmaster Ali review
   - **Resolution needed**: Consigliere (once commissioned) consolidates into Royal Briefing

#### Decisions Made
- **Context window investigation CLOSED**: Prompt caching explains 44% usage (not auto-summarization)
- **Infrastructure priority order**: CURRENT_STATUS.md → ACTIVE_ORDERS.md → logs/ → DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md → SOP_LIBRARY.md
- **DNA/RNA/Protein architecture established**:
  - DNA = Constitution (unchanging GENOME)
  - RNA = ACTIVE_ORDERS.md (current missions)
  - Protein = TASK_REGISTRY.md (granular tasks, may exist in other repos)

#### Files Modified
**Commit 1 (58381a8) - Infrastructure Deployment**:
- Created: `CURRENT_STATUS.md` v1.0.0
- Created: `ACTIVE_ORDERS.md` v1.0.0
- Created: `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` v1.0.0
- Created: `SOP_LIBRARY.md` v1.0.0

- Created: `handoffs/DESKTOP_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (Desktop agent directives)
- Updated: `logs/2025-11-12.md` (this file - final session notes)

#### Git Operations
