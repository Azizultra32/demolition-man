# Agent Life Force System - demolition-man

## What This Project Is

This is the **Agent Life Force System** - a governance and coordination framework for managing persistent AI agent identities across multiple work sessions. Think of it as an "operating system" for AI agent teams working on complex, long-term projects.

## What We're Building

**Core System:**
- Persistent agent identities (GENOME + MOJO = living agents)
- Constitutional governance (rules, procedures, accountability)
- Multi-agent coordination (Builders, Librarians, Adjudicators, etc.)
- Task tracking and mission management
- Documentation that never becomes orphaned or forgotten

**The Goal:** Enable AI agents to work together over weeks/months without losing context, duplicating work, or creating governance chaos. Every agent has a persistent identity, performance history, and clear role.

## How It Works

**Three Core Concepts:**

1. **GENOME (DNA)** - Unchanging class directives for each agent type (Builder, Librarian, etc.)
2. **MOJO (Individual Identity)** - Personal history, ratings, memories for each specific agent
3. **Active Orders (RNA)** - Current missions and tasks that change session-to-session

**Agent Types:**
- **Builder (BROSKI)** - Executes implementation tasks
- **Librarian (HOMESLICE)** - Maintains documentation, prevents context loss
- **Adjudicator (HOMESLICE)** - Enforces rules, resolves disputes
- **Consigliere** - Routes all escalations to Grandmaster Ali
- **Constitution Keeper** - Manages constitutional improvements
- **Twins A & B** - UI/UX specialists (competitive development)

## Where to Start (New AI Reading This)

**CRITICAL: Read these files IN ORDER before doing anything:**

1. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Current state snapshot (version 3.2.0)
2. **ARKPASS_DEV_TENET_PRIME.md** - The Constitution (rules and structure)
3. **handoffs/HANDOFF-2025-11-12-ANUNNAKI.md** - Latest session context
4. **logs/2025-11-12.md** - Today's work log (if it exists)

**If there's a recent handoff file, START THERE FIRST.**

## Current Project State

**Status:** 🟢 OPERATIONAL - System built, governance validated, ready for production missions

**Commissioned Agents:**
- AGENT-00001 (Builder BROSKI) - on standby
- AGENT-00002 (Adjudicator HOMESLICE) - on standby
- AGENT-00003 (Librarian HOMESLICE) - 1 session complete, 4.75/5.0 rating

**Recent Work:**
- Foundation engineering complete
- Constitutional governance v3.1.0 operational
- Governance system validated (GREEN LIGHT)
- Task lifecycle tracking implemented
- Awaiting production mission assignment

## Key Principles (Grandmaster Ali's Rules)

1. **Two-part answers** - Every recommendation needs (1) immediate fix + (2) systemic prevention
2. **Deletion paranoia** - Large deletions are 75% likely mistakes, require explanation
3. **No orphaned files** - All documentation must be in active workflows
4. **Active work hours > calendar time** - System operates on usage hours, not dates
5. **Minimal tokens** - Be concise, no unnecessary explanation
6. **Two is one, one is none** - Redundancy for redundancy (triple backup mindset)

## What We're Working On Now

**Immediate priorities:**
- Create ACTIVE_ORDERS.md (DNA/RNA/Protein separation)
- Create DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (anti-orphan framework)
- Define missing agent roles (Enforcement Agent, Code Review Agent)
- Commission Consigliere (AGENT-00004)

**See handoffs/HANDOFF-2025-11-12-ANUNNAKI.md for complete current context.**

## How to Continue Work

1. Read the handoff file (most recent one in handoffs/)
2. Check CURRENT_STATUS.md for current state
3. Review pending decisions and blockers
4. Ask Grandmaster Ali for guidance if unclear
5. Update coordination files (CURRENT_STATUS, daily log, TASK_REGISTRY) as you work
6. Commit and push changes regularly
7. Create new handoff when session ends or context fills

**This project uses sophisticated AI coordination. Don't improvise - follow the constitution and existing patterns.**

**Questions? Ask Grandmaster Ali before making architectural decisions.**
